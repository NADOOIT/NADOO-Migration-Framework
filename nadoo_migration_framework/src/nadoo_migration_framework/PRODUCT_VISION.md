# Product Vision for NADOO Migration Framework

## Overview
The NADOO Migration Framework is designed to facilitate the seamless migration of projects within the NADOO ecosystem. It aims to provide a comprehensive solution for assessing, migrating, and managing projects with minimal effort and maximum efficiency.

## Key Features

1. **Project Discovery**
   - Automatically scan and list all projects in the specified GitHub directory.
   - Identify projects that meet specific criteria for migration readiness.

2. **Migration Simulation (Dry Run)**
   - Simulate the migration process to assess compatibility with the current framework.
   - Categorize projects based on their migration readiness:
     - **Ready for Migration**: Projects that can be migrated without modifications.
     - **Requires Enhancements**: Projects that need additional features or extensions in the framework.

3. **Interactive GUI**
   - A Toga-based interface displaying a table of projects with actionable buttons.
   - Buttons for "Dry Run" and "Migrate" next to each project.

4. **Reporting and Feedback**
   - Generate reports summarizing the migration status of each project.
   - Provide feedback on projects requiring further development in the framework.

5. **Iterative Improvement**
   - Use feedback to prioritize framework enhancements.
   - Implement necessary features to enable the migration of more projects.
